      "To build a solid foundation for our research, we begin with an in-depth historical study before visiting the site. We look for names, photos, and specific events tied to the property and its previous owners.",

      "Fieldwork starts at dawn and is conducted with modern equipment. We carry out our investigations in the darkness of night, when senses sharpen in the absence of sight.",
      "Collected materials are carefully analyzed afterward to identify patterns and draw conclusions. The results are presented in a documentary film and teaser clips on our social media.",
