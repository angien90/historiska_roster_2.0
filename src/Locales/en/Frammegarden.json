        "Frammegården is one of Sweden's most haunted houses. The house is located on the outskirts of the forests of Värmland, and it is said that the farm was haunted already during Kerstin Eriksson's time.",
        "Before the farm was built, the site served as a gallows hill where people were executed during the 1500s and 1600s; witch burnings are also said to have taken place (myth or truth?).",
        "The entire village was burned down at the end of the 1500s during the conflict between Denmark and Sweden. This reportedly happened on two occasions.",
        "The house is said to have been built in the 1700s, but according to the Swedish Land Survey website, there was a house here in 1643. When the ground floor was renovated, skeletons were found in all four corners and one in front of the fireplace. These remain to this day and are house sacrifices, which were common in earlier times to protect the house.",
        "In 1865, two weeks apart, Kerstin Eriksdotter (4 years old) and Nils Eriksson (2 years old) died of throat disease/diphtheria. It is said they were locked in by their father Erik and starved and froze to death, but maybe they were locked in to protect the rest of the family, especially newborn Anna Eriksdotter. It was thus a form of home quarantine. Photos of these children exist in the house.",
        "Kerstin took over the farm from her father in 1920. She was a single woman and lived a relatively peaceful life on the farm. Kerstin was said to be a strong and independent woman, well-liked by the residents of Skillingsfors. She was known for her hospitality and humor. Since she inherited the farm from her parents, she was very interested in local history and cultural heritage. She actively worked to preserve Frammegården's history and opened it to the public as a local heritage farm. Kerstin welcomed visitors to Frammegården and told them about its history. She was a friendly and knowledgeable hostess who shared her knowledge about the farm and its previous owners. Kerstin loved gardening and took care of Frammegården's green areas. She planted flowers, tended the vegetable garden, and kept the garden in good condition. She was also involved in charity work and helped people in the community. Frammegården was used as a hospice, and Kerstin took care of the terminally ill who lived there. Kerstin Eriksson moved to Stockholm and found love, but her parents forced her back to Frammegården (myth or truth?).",
        "It was during Kerstin's time living in the house that rumors began to spread about it being haunted. When guests asked about footsteps upstairs, she said it was the house spirits and that she was never alone in the house. She would bang on the table with her fist to make them quiet.",
        "In 1941, before Kerstin's death, she donated the house to the Skillingmark Local Heritage Association. Unfortunately, many of Kerstin's belongings were sold due to financial difficulties, despite promises to preserve them.",
        "Arne Weise did a report on Frammegården in the 1950s but stopped around 11 o'clock. During the recording, a strange sound can be heard.",
        "If you visit the cemetery in Skillingmark today, you can see the graves of Nils Nilsson, Björn Nilsson, Erik Nilsson, Kerstin Eriksson, and Anna Eriksson. Kerstin's sister Anna's house also still stands and can be viewed. This house was built in 1926, and Anna lived there until her death in 1950."

      "text": [
        "Footsteps in the attic while we stood above the stairs to the second floor.",
        "Two of us saw shadows in the hallway by the front door while standing inside the kitchen. This happened on two occasions.",
        "As soon as we turned on the equipment in the kitchen, we got communication. We were actually only testing the equipment while unpacking. Clear communication when they released the PRS as soon as we asked them to.",
        "Distinct bangs heard on the ground floor while we were all upstairs.",
        "We asked if Kerstin and Nils are buried in Skillingsmark’s cemetery. The PRS immediately responded after being silent for a long time.",
        "We left a camera in the kitchen and a PRS in the staircase and went outside the house. The PRS went off after a while and when we were sitting outside, a team member thought they saw a shadow in the living room window on the ground floor. When we started to re-enter the house, the PRS gave another signal. Our theory is that when we left, someone came down the stairs (hence the first signal), entered the living room (hence the shadow seen by one member), and when we started going back inside, it went up the stairs again (hence the second PRS signal).",
        "While sitting and eating in the kitchen, we all heard what sounded like a TV or radio playing quietly upstairs. This went on for a long time and came and went.",
        "We had a surveillance camera and a ball placed on the threshold to the attic. When we came up, we saw that the ball had fallen out, but the camera did not register it as movement, so we didn’t capture it. When a team member placed the ball back and turned around, the ball fell out again after a while. However, we did manage to capture this. There was also a signal on a tool on the table as if someone was coming out of the attic.",
        "We had contact upstairs and asked if we should go down. We got the answer 'yes', and when we came down, we immediately got contact in two rooms at the same time with something that turned out to be soldiers shown on a painting on the wall in one of the rooms.",
        "When we were upstairs, we had really good contact using a pendulum.",
        "While we were having contact downstairs in the parlor, we heard something that sounded like a ding from the kitchen. We thought it was the cash register, so we went out and tested it, but it did not sound the same. So we didn’t figure out what it could be.",
        "We got through on the spirit box that we should be careful. This led us into a conversation about bears in the forest, and we thought it best to lock the door, which triggered the PRS and we took that as a yes. When a team member went to lock the door, it was already locked. We had left the door open all day and night since the bathroom is outside, and we knew we hadn’t locked it. Was this the ding we heard from the kitchen?",
        "Around 2:30 AM we left the house, and now afterwards, we don’t really understand why since we were in the middle of good communication. Maybe the house wants us back and wants us to remain curious about it.",
        "We all woke up in the morning feeling that the house is calling us and that we must return."
