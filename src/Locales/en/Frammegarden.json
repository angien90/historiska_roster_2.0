        "Frammegården is one of Sweden's most talked-about haunted houses, located on the edge of the forests of Värmland. The farm has a dramatic history dating back to the 16th century, filled with both tragedies and myths that still persist in the region."

        "Frammegården was built in the 18th century under the name 'Bön' and was used as a residence. According to local tradition, the site is believed to have been an execution site during the witch trials of the 16th and 17th centuries, although no written evidence exists. The village was burned down twice in the late 1500s during conflicts between Sweden and Denmark. When the floor on the ground level was replaced, skeletons were found in all four corners and in front of the fireplace—so-called 'house sacrifices,' an old custom meant to protect the building."

        "In 1865, the Eriksson family suffered a tragedy when two of the children, Kerstin (4 years old) and Nils (2 years old), died of diphtheria. Some stories claim the father locked them in, but church records clearly show they died of illness and were buried at Skillingmark cemetery. The newborn daughter Anna Eriksdotter survived and later continued the family history.",
        "It is also said that the children were locked in by their father Erik and starved or froze to death. Perhaps it was instead an attempt to protect the rest of the family—and especially the newborn Anna—through a form of home quarantine."

        "Kerstin Eriksson took over the farm in 1920. She was a strong and independent woman, known for her hospitality and humor. With a passionate interest in local history and cultural heritage, she took care of both the garden and the sick in the community, and was engaged in charity work. She opened Frammegården to the public as a local heritage site and donated it in 1941 to the Skillingmark Heritage Association to preserve it for the future. Many of Kerstin's belongings were unfortunately sold due to financial difficulties, even though they had promised to preserve them according to the contract.",

        "Part of the house is called 'the mortuary room,' where seriously ill people were cared for during the 19th century. Even today, visitors feel a heavy atmosphere here. During Kerstin's time, footsteps were often heard from the upper floor, which she explained as 'the house spirits.' When they became too noisy, she would knock on the table to quiet them. In the 1950s, journalist Arne Weise interrupted a report in the house after mysterious sounds were heard."

        "Torpet farm is located a short distance from Frammegården. The house was built in 1926 by Anna's four children, who wanted to create a home for their mother after establishing their careers. Anna lived there and took care of pigs, chickens, and crops. The upper floor had four bedrooms—one for each child and their family. Torpet became a family farm and a natural gathering place for relatives and villagers, with large coffee gatherings, celebrations, and lively Christmases. The children and their families also spent summers here with Anna.",
        "Anna was a single mother for most of her life and took care of her four children on her own. She was a resourceful woman who invested everything in her children's education. To finance their studies in Karlstad and Uppsala, she sold both forest land and a house (Gärdet). Two of her sons became doctors, her daughter a dentist, and the eldest son a business economist.",
        "During World War II, the farm was requisitioned by the military and used as an officers' mess, canteen, and housing for officers.",
        "Many feel a special harmony in the house, and highly sensitive individuals describe positive energies. It is also said that the house is arranged according to Feng Shui principles.",
        "Today's owners lean toward a spiritual worldview but do not want to risk disturbing any potential spirits. The belief is that if anything remains, it is only of good intent."

        "During the Second World War, Skillingmark in western Värmland became an important hub at the border with Norway. Thousands of Norwegian refugees, couriers, and secret messages passed through the area on their way into Sweden.",
        "The farm Mörkerud, owned by the siblings Ola and Lina Olsson, played a central role as a hiding place and base for the resistance movement. Many of the local inhabitants also took part in the relief efforts by helping to move people, money, and information across the border. Organizations such as Milorg and the agent group Hector had connections to the farm.",
        "Individual refugees also found shelter in the area. In a cottage near Nissedråga, Långebäck, the German deserter Willi Jutzi, for example, spent the night with his partner in 1941.",
        "At the same time, there were strong divisions in the community. The Nazi-sympathizing priest Hilding Malmgren sang German war songs, sent telegrams to Hitler, and decorated the vicarage with swastikas.",
        "As previously mentioned, Anna Eriksson’s cottage was used as an officers’ mess, canteen, and accommodation for officers, which suggests that Frammegården may also have played a significant role."

        "When we arrived at the house, we began, as usual, to check the guest books, partly to see what those who had been there before us had experienced. One member asked another if they remembered which book we wrote in last, but the answer was no – we didn’t remember. The person standing by the guest books then picked up a completely random book, opened a page – and there, right before our eyes, was our text from 2024. What are the odds? Perhaps the house wanted to show that it remembered us.",
        "After we had started unpacking and were about to take some drone shots, we ran into technical issues. First, the drone warned of low battery and landed automatically. Even after we replaced the battery, the problems continued. On a new attempt, we got it running, but after a while it reported that the GPS signal was lost – and for some strange reason, the drone flew straight into a bush, breaking one of its wings. The technical problems continued throughout the evening.",
        "A fully charged Knäckt suddenly died – due to no battery.",
        "The Polterscript hung up in the room above the stairs. This time, the batteries were charged, but even after restarting it didn’t work until we took out the batteries and reinserted them.",
        "When we tried to take photos outside late in the evening, the phone kept coming loose from the selfie stick mount and fell to the ground. The mount and phone had otherwise worked perfectly on many other investigations.",
        "During dinner in the large room on the ground floor, we had some equipment running around us. Among other things, a cat ball on the blue cabinet in the corner. It activated several times during the meal, almost as if someone wanted to interject into our conversation.",
        "We had contact with Father Erik, who stood in the hallway above the stairs. He communicated via the PMB but did not want to enter the rooms we were in. Among other things, he wanted to convey that he never locked his children in the attic – it’s just a myth.",
        "We tried something new called three-way communication, using a pendulum board, yes/no cards, and a recorder. It gave really amazing communication, as many questions received verified answers. The most fascinating answer in the living room concerned our new member on the trip – whether it was meant for them to come along. The pendulum gave a clear yes, the yes/no card showed only yes, and the cat ball on the blue cabinet, which had already activated during dinner, started blinking again.",
        "We also tried three-way communication in the living room upstairs, and there we received less friendly answers – almost as if we were talking to a grumpy teenager.",
        "We received German words and answers to German questions in the morgue, which ties back to the 2024 investigation, when we received German words in exactly the same room.",
        "Just before 10:00 PM, we were sitting in the living room on the ground floor when we suddenly heard sounds like children talking. It happened on two occasions, about five minutes apart, and it sounded like a girl aged around 6–12 years.",
        "After this, we received very tricky responses on the equipment – almost as if someone pretended to be a child but wasn’t, and had no good intentions. Among other things, it tried to get us to talk to the clown in the attic, as the girl was supposedly trapped there. The Knäckt mapped a child by the attic, which then grew and became much larger.",
        "Later in the evening, we mapped another child who was sitting or hiding behind the rocking chair. One of the members went forward to play with the child, but suddenly its identity merged into the person. Was it really a child, we wondered?",
        "We had a PMB in the morgue for an extended period, and it seemed to move completely on its own. It was exactly the same type of phenomenon we experienced in 2024. Perhaps it’s someone who prefers to communicate from a distance – and who seems to appreciate the PMB’s melody. While it was active, we continued to explore the house. Among other things, we went up to the room above the stairs. There, we asked via the Spiritbox if the identity downstairs could come up to us. We got the answer no. When we followed up with the question whether the energies downstairs couldn’t come up – and vice versa – we got the answer yes. Perhaps there are different energies on each floor. It was very noticeable this time: a more “cozy” energy downstairs, while the atmosphere upstairs felt significantly more threatening.",
        "During the evening, we received words like run, truck, and similar on the Polterscript. When we asked whether the house intended to scare us out, since we had planned to stay overnight, we got no answer. The investigation ended, and we got in the car and drove home – whether it was because of what we experienced, the words we received, the mice running around on the ground floor, or just the need to deal with life the next day, we do not know. But we all felt a sense of unease that we hadn’t felt the last time we were there."
