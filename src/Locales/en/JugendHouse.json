        "The name of the village has been spelled in several different ways throughout history: Marthaklef (1351), Mårdaklef (1406) and Mårdaklet (1894). One interpretation is that it derives from Mördaklef (Murder Chasm), referring to a battle between Danes and Swedes said to have taken place here. Until the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, when Halland became Swedish, the Danish–Swedish border ran just south of Mårdaklev, which made the area both militarily sensitive and strategically important. The Ätran valley was a main route between the coast and the inland. At Klev there was a border crossing with customs and a posting station, and when the border situation eventually stabilized, the inn was established.",
        "There are, however, other explanations for the place name. The word *klev* in Old Swedish means a cleft, ravine, or mountain pass – something that fits well with the landscape around Mårdaklev. The prefix *Mårda-* may in turn refer to the animal marten. The name can therefore also be interpreted as “the marten’s cleft” or similar, reflecting both the natural formations and people’s closeness to wildlife. Both the dramatic tradition of the ‘Murder Chasm’ and the linguistic-historical interpretations show how place names can often carry several layers of meaning.",
        "Mårdaklev Church replaced an older wooden church from 1688. However, the preserved medieval baptismal font suggests that a church had existed in the parish even earlier."

        "Klev Inn (property 1:72) has its roots in the 17th century – the activity is documented as early as 1695 – and was established as a stopping place along the Ätrastigen route. Ätrastigen was a travel road between the Halland coast and the inland, used by farmers, merchants, and soldiers. In the 17th century the Inn Ordinance was introduced, which required inns to be placed at regular intervals (often 15–20 km) so that travelers could stop, eat, and change horses. Innkeepers were also obliged to maintain stables and draft horses ready for couriers and travelers, often with the help of local farmers who were required to contribute with relay horses. In return, the innkeeper received certain privileges, such as rights to serve alcohol and tax benefits. Klev Inn was therefore an important hub for both travelers and transport – and may also have functioned as a transfer point for mail. The inn remained in operation in its original form until the 1950s.",
        "Three main buildings have been preserved: the oldest house from around 1750, originally the farm residence; the main building from 1836, which served as the tenant farmer's residence; and a third building which over the years was used both as a tavern and a lodging room – a place where travelers could rest, eat, and drink.",
        "Household examinations were introduced in Sweden after the Church Act of 1686, but in many parishes, records were only kept from the 1700s. In Kalv parish, where Mårdaklev was located, church archives have been preserved from 1722. Unfortunately, this means we cannot trace who lived on the farms before that time.",
        "In the household examination records, the building is referred to as Kleven and belonged to District No.5. Two families consistently lived in Kleven. From 1841 onwards, it is also noted that the farms Högklef and Kullen belonged to Kleven, while Stora Höghult and Lilla Höghult were owned by Högklef. From 1849, Marielund was also owned by Högaklef.",
        "Conclusions from the household examination records show that many people died during the 19th century. Between 1813–1819, epidemic diseases ravaged Sweden, including dysentery, which between 1808–1813 claimed around 50,000 lives. Measles, whooping cough (pertussis), and scarlet fever were also common and particularly deadly among children. Influenza also occurred, especially during harsh winters.",
        "Since Klevs Inn welcomed travelers and guests coming and going, it is possible that diseases were spread to the farm via visitors. This shows that even small parishes like Mårdaklev could be strongly affected by disease and high mortality.",
        "It is difficult to determine the burial sites of many of the people listed below, but they are likely buried at Mårdaklev Church."
