        "The name of the place has been spelled in several ways over time: Marthaklef (1351), Mårdaklef (1406), and Mårdaklet (1894). One interpretation is that it derives from Mördaklef (The Murderer’s Gap), referring to a battle between Danes and Swedes that is said to have taken place here. Until the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, when Halland became Swedish, the Denmark–Sweden border ran just south of Mårdaklev. This made the area both militarily sensitive and strategically important. The Ätran valley was a main route between the coast and the inland. At Klev, there was a border crossing with customs and a relay station, and when the border situation eventually stabilized, the inn was established.",
        "Mårdaklev Church replaced an older wooden church from 1688. However, the preserved medieval baptismal font suggests that there was already a church in the parish earlier."

        "Klevs Inn has its roots in the 17th century – the business is documented as early as 1695 – and was established as a stop along the Ätrastigen route. The inn operated in its original form until the 1950s.",
        "Three main buildings have been preserved: the oldest house, from around 1750, which originally served as the farm's residence; the main building from 1836, which functioned as the tenant's residence; and a third building that over the years was used both as a serving hall and as lodging for travelers – a place where wanderers could rest, eat, and drink.",
        "Household examinations were introduced in Sweden after the Church Law of 1686, but in many parishes, records began only in the 18th century. In Kalv parish, which included Mårdaklev, church archives have been preserved from 1722. Unfortunately, this means we cannot trace who lived on the farms before that.",
        "In the household records, the building is referred to as Kleven and belonged to Roten no.5. Two families consistently lived in Kleven. From 1841 onward, it is also recorded that the farms Högklef and Kullen belonged to Kleven, and Stora Höghult and Lilla Höghult were owned by Högklef. From 1849, Marielund was also owned by Högklef.",
        "Conclusions from the household records show that many people died during the 19th century. Between 1813–1819, epidemic diseases swept Sweden, including dysentery, which during 1808–1813 claimed about 50,000 lives. Measles, whooping cough (pertussis), and scarlet fever were also common and particularly deadly among children. Influenza occurred as well, especially during harsh winters.",
        "Since Klevs Inn received travelers and guests who came and went, it is possible that diseases spread to the farm through visitors. This shows that even small parishes like Mårdaklev could be heavily affected by disease and high mortality."
