        "In connection with Jugendhouse, we organized a ghost hunt event at Klevs Inn.",
        "Participants enjoyed a delicious three-course dinner in the company of others who shared their interest in the supernatural. During the dinner, the fascinating history of the house and location was told.",
        "Those who wanted could also share their own supernatural experiences – a way to create both excitement and a sense of community ahead of the evening's investigation.",
        "After dinner, participants were given an introduction to the ghost hunting equipment used in investigations, and then had the opportunity to try it themselves – either in groups or individually, depending on what they felt comfortable with.",
        "For the truly daring, there was an opportunity to stay overnight at their guesthouse, which had a few available rooms."
