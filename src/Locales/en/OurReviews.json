      "text": "We are grateful and happy that the group Historical Voices chose Rydals Manor for their investigation. They stayed with us for a couple of days to sense whether there was any truth to the strong feelings of presence that people have spoken about for over 150 years. Historical Voices later invited us to be part of their findings and experience it for ourselves. It was an incredible and enriching evening — respectful and informative — and we are truly fascinated by their work and grateful to have been a part of it.",
