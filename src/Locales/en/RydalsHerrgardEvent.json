        "On May 30, we organized an event together with Rydals Manor where our guests were treated to a three-course dinner in the company of like-minded people with a shared interest in the supernatural.",
        "After dinner, participants received an introduction to the equipment used in ghost investigations, and the opportunity to try the equipment themselves â€“ both individually and in groups, depending on what they felt most comfortable with. During the evening, several guests experienced unexpected activity through various instruments and methods."
