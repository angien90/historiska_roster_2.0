        "Fastarp 2:13, popularly known as the Railway Hotel, was built in 1889. Over the years, the house has taken many forms – it served as an inn between 1889 and 1910, but has also been a private residence. In the southern part of the building, there have been various businesses: a country store, café, fabric shop, video rental, clothing store, pharmacy outlet, shoe store, and a toy and gift shop.",
        "Apart from some renovations during the 1960s and 70s, the timber building, about 450 square meters in size, is largely preserved in its original condition. It features four tiled stoves (originally seven), beautiful wooden floors, and two glass verandas."

        "Johan, also known as 'Carpenter Johan,' built the Railway Hotel sometime between 1889 and 1890. The building replaced the older inn in the area and marked the beginning of a new chapter in Tvååker’s innkeeping tradition.",
        "In 1868, Johan married Börta Andersdotter, born July 4, 1841, in Sven Börsgård, Fastarp, who passed away on September 15, 1927. Börta was deaf, and together they had the children Johannes (b. December 14, 1868 – d. October 31, 1929, declared dead January 26, 1938; emigrated to America in 1889), Brita Lovisa (b. July 5, 1870), Emma Dorotea (b. December 28, 1872), Sofia Gustafva (b. July 30, 1874), Josefina Charlotta (b. August 26, 1876 – d. October 26, 1967 in Fastarp), Anders (b. June 2, 1878), Anna Johanna (b. July 5, 1879), and Lovisa (b. November 29, 1884).",
        "Also living on the farm was mother-in-law Johanna Gustafsson (b. September 24, 1814 – d. August 13, 1902), who became a widow in 1869. The family also employed several farmhands, a maid, and a pauper named Anders Peter Olsson (b. July 25, 1818 – d. October 1, 1898).",
        "The children gradually moved out, and in 1908, Johan and Börta also left the farm."

After a dispute with Johan Johansson, Olof moved his business in 1909 to a newly built house across the road. In 1912, the cooperative 'Konsum Framåt' took over the store premises. The family moved to Varberg in the fall of 1915.",
        "Together with his wife Anna Svensson (b. 1870 in Grimmered), Olof had ten children: Edit (b. March 3, 1894), Rut (b. October 20, 1895), Olof Torsten (b. May 16, 1897), Lars Gunnar (b. July 7, 1899), Margit (b. December 26, 1900), Carin Dagmar (b. April 8, 1903), Bror Gösta (b. November 19, 1904), Anna Margareta (b. April 3, 1906), Ester Ingegerd (b.

They had four children: Carl Ivar (1903–1986), Carin Maria, called 'Maja' (1905–1977), Tore David (1906–1988), and Svea Ingrid (1912–2001). The family moved to Fastarp No. 2 in 1919. All the children were born in Tvååker, except Carl Ivar, who was born and died in Gothenburg. Ingrid also passed away in Gothenburg.",
        "In 1972, Christer Bergendahl (b. April 28, 1938 – d. November 21, 2024) took over the business from his grandfather. The enterprise had been passed down through his father David Bergendahl and his mother Elsa Julia Margareta Johansson."

        "Oscar purchased the house as a private residence in 1919. Older oral accounts place the purchase around 1910, while some documents indicate 1919 as the official year of ownership. During Oscar’s time at the property, the verandas that still adorn the house were added.",

March 1, 1926 – d. 2018), Hans Oscar Kjell (b. July 1, 1928 – d. 2004), Alf Oscar Kjell (b. July 24, 1920 – d. 1979), and Gunborg Katarine, called 'Tullan' (b. October 14, 1921 – d. 2009).",
        "Oscar sold agricultural machinery and had a machine hall on the property. His gravestone bears the title 'Merchant.' In 1938, the machine hall burned down in a fire, which led Oscar to sell his machinery. He moved out in 1949, leaving the house to his daughter Sonja, who lived there unmarried until her death in 2018."

Here you’ll find a unique historical atmosphere, homemade pastries, and delicious meals served in an inspiring and charming setting.",
        "During the renovation, the goal was to preserve the turn-of-the-century style. All rooms feature wallpapers inspired by 1880–1910 patterns, and much of the interior was sourced from flea markets and auctions. The house’s structure remains largely in its original condition."
