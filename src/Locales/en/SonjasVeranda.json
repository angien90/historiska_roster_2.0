      "Fastarp 2:13, commonly known as the Railway Hotel, was built in 1889. Over the years, the building has had many functions – it operated as an inn from 1889 to 1910, but has also served as a private residence. The southern part of the building has housed a general store, café, fabric shop, video rental, clothing store, pharmacy outlet, shoe store, and a toy and gift shop.",
      "Apart from some renovations in the 1960s and 1970s, the timber building, covering approximately 450 square meters, has largely been preserved in its original state. It features four tiled stoves (originally seven), beautiful wooden floors, and two glass verandas."

      "Johan, also known as 'Carpenter Johan', built the Railway Hotel sometime between 1889 and 1890. The building replaced the older inn in the area and marked the beginning of a new chapter in Tvååker's innkeeping tradition.",
      "In 1868, Johan married Börta Andersdotter, born July 4, 1841, in Sven Börsgård, Fastarp, and died September 15, 1927. Börta was deaf, and together they had children: Johannes (b. December 14, 1868 – d. October 31, 1929; declared dead January 26, 1938; emigrated to America in 1889), Brita Lovisa (b. July 5, 1870), Emma Dorotea (b. December 28, 1872), Sofia Gustafva (b. July 30, 1874), Josefina Charlotta (b. August 26, 1876 – d. October 26, 1967 in Fastarp), Anders (b. June 2, 1878), Anna Johanna (b. July 5, 1879), and Lovisa (b. November 29, 1884).",
      "Also living on the farm was mother-in-law Johanna Gustafsson (b. September 24, 1814 – d. August 13, 1902), who became a widow in 1869. The family also had several farmhands, a maid, and a pauper named Anders Peter Olsson (b. July 25, 1818 – d. October 1, 1898).",
      "The children gradually left home, and in 1908 Johan and Börta also moved away from the farm.",
      "Johan and his wife Börta, along with their daughter Lovisa and her husband Karl Nilsson (b. March 2, 1891 – d. April 27, 1960), are buried in Tvååker Cemetery (Tv NÖ 61)."

      "He leased the inn and set up a general store in the southern part of the building. After a dispute with Johan Johansson, Olof moved his business in 1909 to a newly built house on the other side of the road. In 1912, Konsum Framåt took over the premises for their operations. The family moved to Varberg in the autumn of 1915.",
      "Together with his wife Anna Svensson (b. 1870 in Grimmered), Olof had ten children: Edit (b. March 3, 1894), Rut (b. October 20, 1895), Olof Torsten (b. May 16, 1897), Lars Gunnar (b.

      "In 1902, Ivar married Lovisa Justina Larsson (b. March 11, 1878, in Tvååker – d. May 31, 1930, by suicide by throwing herself in front of a train. She was a widow at the time). They had four children: Carl Ivar (1903–1986), Carin Maria, called 'Maja' (1905–1977), Tore David (1906–1988), and Svea Ingrid (1912–2001). The family moved to Fastarp No. 2 in 1919. All children were born in Tvååker except Carl Ivar, who was born and died in Gothenburg. Ingrid also died in Gothenburg.",
      "In 1972, Christer Bergendahl (b. April 28, 1938 – d. November 21, 2024) took over the business from his grandfather. The business had then passed down through his father Tore David Bergendahl and his wife Elsa Julia Margareta Johansson.",
      "Ivar and his wife Lovisa, along with children Tore and 'Maja', are buried in Tvååker Cemetery (Tv NÖ 224). In the same grave lie their grandchild Elsa Julia Margareta Bergendahl, Klara Margareta Bergendahl (b. 1847 – d. 1926), and Per-Anders Ivar Bergendahl (b. January 5, 1947 – d. April 25, 2017)."

      "Oscar purchased the house as a private residence in 1919. Older oral accounts suggest the purchase was around 1910, while some documents indicate 1919 as the official ownership year. During Oscar's time, the verandas were added, which still adorn the house today.",
      "On May 15, 1920, Oscar married Sofia Alma Andersson (b. November 1, 1894, in Ljungby – d. January 13, 1974, in Fastarp 2, Tvååker). They had four children: Sonja Marianne Katrine (b. March 1, 1926 – d. 2018), Hans Oscar Kjell (b. July 1, 1928 – d. 2004), Alf Oscar Kjell (b. July 24, 1920 – d. 1979), and Gunborg Katarine, called 'Tullan' (b. October 14, 1921 – d. 2009).",
      "Oscar sold agricultural machinery and had a machine hall on the farm. His gravestone bears the title 'Merchant'. In 1938, the machine hall burned down in a fire, leading Oscar to sell his agricultural machinery. He moved out of the farm in 1949 and passed the house to his daughter Sonja, who lived there unmarried until her death in 2018."

After careful renovation, they opened the doors to Sonja's Veranda in 2022 – a place you are happy to return to. Here, visitors experience a unique historical atmosphere, homemade pastries, and well-prepared meals in an environment that both inspires and charms.",
      "During the renovation, the aim was to preserve the turn-of-the-century style. All rooms are wallpapered with patterns from 1880–1910, and much of the furnishing was sourced from flea markets and auctions. The building's structure remains largely preserved in its original state."
